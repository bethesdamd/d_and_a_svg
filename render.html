<h2>Programmatic generation of SVG using Python</h2>
<p>The following graphic is a screenshot of SVG created dynamically from a CSV data source using Python and an SVG library.  This was for an unsolicited proof of concept, for a prospective client, and is not the final version but a demonstration of what's possible in a limited amount of development time.</p>

<p>The problem: the firm uses manual tools like Illustrator to create reports that contain data, logos and images, and they have to do this frequently. This is a very time-consuming and tedious process.  I demonstrated a way to do this programmatically in seconds from a CSV file and a directory of images.  The SVG would then be imported into a publishing tool.</p>
